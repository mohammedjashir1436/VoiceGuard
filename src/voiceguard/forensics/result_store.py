"""Bounded in-memory store of server-verified detection results.

A forensic report must be based on a verdict VoiceGuard actually produced, not on
a verdict supplied by the client. ``/detect`` records its result here keyed by the
audio SHA-256; ``/forensic/report`` looks it up by hash and refuses (404) if there
is no server-side record. The store is process-local, LRU-bounded, and lost on
restart (acceptable for the demo's short-lived report flow).
